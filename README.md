# Welcome to the source code for my personal website. 
## Note: 
- I am using a _very_ basic Jekyll theme named "no-style-please", originally done by Riccardo Graziosi, and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). I am in no way trying to take credit away from them, and will attach their README as well to this repository for anyone else curious to do something similar. 
- This project has been active since December 2021, essentially scrapped my previous website, and made this one instead. Originally when I wrote my website back in December 2020, I knew it was good, but only a starting point. As I've learned more, I want to be able to do a lot better for myself and display my projects in a very clean way.
