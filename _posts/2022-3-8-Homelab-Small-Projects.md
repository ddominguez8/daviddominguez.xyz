As the title mentions, this might feel more of a blog post rather than a write up. I have not gotten around to updating in a while since I've been extremely busy. Firstly, my job search is over as I've accepted a position as an Associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers, under their Microsoft Cyber Defense Team, working under their Azure infrastructure! Super excited beyond belief. 

I will probably be making each of these projects their own pages after I finish taking time off, but for now this will just be a small update. 

## Zeek - Network Analysis
Zeek is a network analysis tool that can be used to quickly organize network traffic. This came from a conversation I had with my mentor who suggested I look into this, so I will be updating my learning potentially in another post. Essentially I've been exposed to it and can see the importance of it in an enterprise environment.

## Golang CLI
I am currently writing a CLI in Golang that will emulate the functionality of a Linux terminal. It only supports "cd" and "ls" commands as of now, however I will keep working on it. It is very early in its stages and continuously keep moving forward. Source code can be found [here.](https://github.com/ddominguez8/go-cli)

## Homelab 
My homelab has been designed out, however now I have to save some money to be able to afford everything. Obviously since I am awaiting to start my new job, I am out of money right now to afford for it. However, I did sketch up a network architecture of it, just for fun. 

Although I can't get to juicy parts of messing around with servers, I did end up working on my Pi-Hole at home. However, it is currently on standby, since for some reason I am continuing to have issues with it. At first, I had reason to believe it was rate limiting queries, however now I believe it oddly may be an inconsitent power source (the current rig is very cheap, a multi-year old power extension cord so that the Rpi can be close enough with the very small length Cat6 cables I have). It tends to completely be unable to resolve any queries, typically for about 2 minutes. The web interface dashboard does not show any errors when I load it so I will have to keep looking into it. I ran a script that tested with about 10,000 queries back to back (after fixing rate limiting) and returned with 0 errors.

## Nextcloud 
I am currently running an instance of Nextcloud on an instance of mine through Vultr. It is very cost effective and I will continue to use it as a testing environment so that when I get my homelab up and running I can use it permanently with my own hardware. 

## MITRE ATT&CK Matrix
Finally, I am ongoing learning the ATT&CK Matrix, although it is still in beginner stages.
