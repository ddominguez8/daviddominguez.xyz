So, allow me to give some backstory. A very good friend of mine had been using Jekyll (I'm still learning as I currently write this, this project isn't finished) and I loved the way his website looked. In addition, I was tired of my personal website looking like something out of 2003. If you know me personally you know I have a massive appreciation for the arts but myself, I don't have too much of an artist's touch. So I was looking for a very minimal theme so that it would be functional and pretty uniform no matter who checked out my site. Thankfully, I found this theme off a different [repository](https://github.com/snmslavk/awesome-jekyll-websites) that has many jekyll themes, and found someone else who had this theme.
